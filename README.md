# Predicting dissatisfaction using Latent Semantic Scaling 

This repository provides code related to Mizuki Kobayashi's graduation thesis, "Predicting Dissatisfaction using Latent Semantic Scaling (LSS) based Emotion Polarity Values."

## Overview

In this project, we apply LSS to texts containing dissatisfaction to calculate emotion polarity values and investigate how well these values can predict human dissatisfaction ratings. For background information and methodology, please refer to Mizuki Kobayashi's graduation thesis.

## Data

The data used in this project is the "Dissatisfaction Survey Dataset" provided by Insight Tech through the National Institute of Informatics' IDR Dataset Service. For detailed information about the data and its usage, please visit [here](https://www.nii.ac.jp/dsc/idr/fuman/).
